1. Return spots which have a domain with a count greater than 1:
SELECT name, website
FROM MY_TABLE
WHERE website IN (
    SELECT website
    FROM MY_TABLE
    GROUP BY website
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);

2. Change the website field, so it only contains the domain. Example: https://domain.com/index.php â†’ domain.com:
UPDATE MY_TABLE
SET website = regexp_replace(website, '^https?://([^/?#]+).*$', '\1')
WHERE website ~ '^https?://([^/?#]+).*';
Note: The above query assumes that the website column contains URLs starting with either "http://" or "https://". If the URLs have a different format, the regular expression pattern may need to be adjusted accordingly.

3. Count how many spots have the same domain:
SELECT website, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM MY_TABLE
GROUP BY website;


4. Return 3 columns: spot name, domain, and the count number for the domain:
SELECT name, website, count
FROM (
    SELECT name, website, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY website) AS count
    FROM MY_TABLE
) AS subquery
WHERE count > 1;
